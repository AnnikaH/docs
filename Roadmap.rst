Roadmap
=======

Current goal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Become "Node++": enable people to develop tiny, self-contained, Node.js-style web services, with RESTful API's, in a highly efficient C++.

IncludeOS is a perfect match for `immutable infrastructure <http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/06/an-introduction-to-immutable-infrastructure.html>`__ and `micro service <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices>`__ architectures. We also want to demonstrate that our approach to OS design is inherently more secure than classical operating systems: you can't attack what isn't there.

Projects 2016
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Complete IP4-stack, including ethernet, ARP, UDP, TCP, ICMP and DHCP
-  Basic IPv6 support, including NDP
-  A package manager
-  github-based, much like `bower <http://bower.io/>`__/`npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__.
-  A minimal HTTP module (package), just enough http for REST
-  Simple, flat file system module (package), for serving static web-content
-  Database integration
    + SQLite
    + MongoDB
-  RESTful API framework
-  TLS
-  Open-stack deployment toolkit

Further goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Multi-core support
-  Context-switching timers
